, write an algorithm that represents the 
steps of the robots in the fleet and the dinosaurs in the herd battling. Think about the steps that need 
to happen to implement the functionality.


 Algorithm for Robots Vs dinosaurs

 1. Select the object that I want to attack with. 

 3. display all of the objects that I can attack

 2. select the object that I want to attack.

 3. call the attack function on




 ///////////////////////////////

 Notes: 

 Run Game is the master function that calls other functions

 Display Welcome will be called in init

 Battle is where all the logic is stored such as sequence of attacks, status of objects at the end of the attack, 
  if object dies then remove that object, check health, display health

dino turn will call the show opponenet options functionality

Show available opponents will display the oppenents available to be attacked. Need to have a way to select the object prior to attck.
